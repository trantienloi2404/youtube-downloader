## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.18 or later recommended)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- **`yt-dlp`**: You need to have `yt-dlp` installed and accessible in your system's PATH. Follow the official installation guide.
- **`ffmpeg`**: Required by `yt-dlp` for merging formats and embedding data. Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and in your PATH. Follow the official installation guide.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-downloader.git
    cd youtube-downloader
    ```

    _(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)_

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or
    # npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    # or
    # npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```

4.  Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

The application uses Next.js API Routes to handle backend operations:

- `/api/fetch-video`: Fetches metadata for a single video.
- `/api/fetch-playlist`: Fetches metadata for a playlist.
- `/api/download-video`: Handles downloading a single video and streaming progress/file.
- `/api/download-playlist`: Handles downloading multiple videos from a playlist, zipping them, and streaming progress/file.

_(Note: The download endpoints use a two-step process: POST to initiate and stream progress, then GET to retrieve the final file.)_

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js.

**Important:** Deploying this application requires a server environment where `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` can be executed. Standard Vercel serverless functions might not support this directly due to execution limitations or missing binaries. You might need to explore Vercel Hobby plan (if limitations allow) or alternative hosting solutions that provide more control over the execution environment (like a VPS or container-based services).

Check out the Next.js deployment documentation for more details.
